   <title type="text">The Kish Collection</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/kish/introduction.asp"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Kish Collection</span></a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><img alt="http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/kish/introduction_pageimages/header.jpg" class="decoded" height="43" src="http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/kish/introduction_pageimages/header.jpg" width="400" /> <span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The ancient city of Kish was  occupied from at least as early as 3200 B.C. through the 7th century  A.D. Located on the floodplain of the Euphrates River eighty kilometers  south of modern Baghdad, the city held an extraordinary position during  the formative periods of Mesopotamian history. At that time, it seems to  have been the only important city in the northern part of the alluvium,  while there were several major centers in the south. The ancient  Mesopotamians regarded Kish as the first city to which "kingship  descended from heaven" after the great flood that had destroyed the  world. During the third millennium B.C., rule over Kish implied  dominance over the entire northern part of the plain, and the title  "King of Kish" bestowed prestige analogous to that of the medieval "Holy  Roman Emperor."<br /> <br /> <table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0">  <tbody><tr>   <td>    <div align="right">     <br />    </div></td>  </tr></tbody></table>From 1923 through 1933, joint archaeological  expeditions of The Field Museum of Natural History and Oxford University  explored many of the twenty-four-square-kilometer site's forty mounds,  uncovering significant evidence of Kish's extremely early urbanization  and its prominence as a dominant regional polity. However, no final site  report of the work of those seasons was ever published.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></span><span style="color: #252525; font-size: x-small;">T</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">he lack of a final site report for  Kish stands as a significant lacuna in the archaeological record of  Mesopotamia, effectively precluding an understanding of the true  historical significance of this crucial Mesopotamian city. The Field  Museum, along with the Ashmolean Museum and the Iraq Museum, hope to  make such a final publication of the Kish excavations a reality. Roger  Moorey, in the preface to his 1978 work <i>Kish Excavations 1923-1933</i>, undertaken to produce a catalogue of the Ashmolean's Kish holdings, concisely encapsulates the necessity of this endeavor:  </span><br /><ul><span style="font-size: x-small;">"In undertaking this project, nearly fifty years after the  excavations were started, I have been very conscious that the original  work was inspired by aims no longer recognized as viable and executed by  methods which were largely inadequate...It would be to confound the  evil if the results of this excavation were for these reasons ignored  and the finds, with what is left of the records, allowed to suffer  further neglect. It would be particularly so at a time when fresh  excavations at Kish on this scale are unlikely, though modern  development there is radically modifying the site. Ideally all three  collections should be fully published as a single unit..." (pp. viii,  xxi)  </span></ul><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">This website details  the history, progress, and future prospects of the Kish Project, a  federally funded effort to virtually reconcile and publish, in both  print and digital formats, the expansive—and divided—collection of  ancient material culture from the Mesopotamian city of Kish.</span></span></blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 511px;"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="20"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><br /></span>          <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><br /></span>          <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><br /></span>         <br />                   </td>        <td align="left" valign="top" width="471"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br />          <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/kish/introduction.asp">Introduction</a> | <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/kish/past.asp">Kish:  Past, Present, and Future</a> | <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/kish/gallery_object.asp">Gallery</a> | <a href="http://fm6.fieldmuseum.org/kish/kishSearch2.aspx">Kish Database</a> | <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/kish/funding.asp">Funding</a> | <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/kish/partners.asp">Partners</a></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="http://fm6.fieldmuseum.org/kish/images/40-clpx.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" height="5" src="http://fm6.fieldmuseum.org/kish/images/40-clpx.gif" width="40" /></a>]]></content>
