   <title type="text">Basilica Aemilia Onine</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/?q=en/node/220">The Basilica Aemilia</a><br />Christine Ertel - Klaus Stefan Freyberger - Kathrin Tacke –  T. Bitterer, The Basilica Aemilia on the Forum Romanum in Rome. Focus of  public life.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">According  to Livius (40, 51, 4-5), the original building was inaugurated by the  censors M. Aemilius Lepidus and M. Fulvius Nobilior 179 B.C. The  basilica was a single-story construction with a nave and two aisles on  either side. The construction material was tuff, a local type of  volcanic rock, and also travertine, limestone, which originated from  Tivoli. Several fire disasters made it necessary to restore and renew  the building. In the early years of the 1st century B.C., the basilica  was converted into a two-story building. It was completely renovated  under the reign of Augustus after a fire in 14 A.D. without  fundamentally changing the form of the previous buildings, but by using a  different material: marble from Luni. The floor of the nave was  decorated with precious polychrome marble while the floor of the side  aisles was covered with white marble. The marble cladding of the inside  walls were also decorated with reliefs of pentelic marble, representing  significant scenes of the founding history of Rome. The portico facing  the forum had a lavish façade with doric columns crowned by a high  attic. The outer side of the attic showed sumptuous sculptural  decorations. In the center of the parapet plates were the imagines  clipeatae, showing probably Parthian officials. Those were flanked by  monumental barbarian statues sculpted from coloured marble. Even though  it is not possible to clearly reconstruct the statuary type of the  barbarians, it is likely that those statues also showed Parthian  officials, symbolising a nation subjected by the Romans. They refer to  Augustus’ not only military but also diplomatic victory concluding a  peace treaty with the Parthians in 20 B.C. Above the portico and the  shops there was a monumental terrace, which, in the rear part, was  surmounted by a loggia, decorated by the well-known pillars with tendril  motives. In all probability, this terrace is to be identified with the  maeniana mentioned by ancient authors. From the maeniana it was possible  to watch the activities on the Forum Romanum but it was also used as a  spectators' stand for celebrations and processions.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="einsprung">  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/?q=en/node/167">to publication</a></span></div><div class="einsprung">  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/arachne/index.php?view%5Blayout%5D=search_result_overview&amp;view%5Bcategory%5D=overview&amp;view%5Bcaller%5D%5Bproject%5D=220&amp;search%5Bconstraints%5D=Basilica%20Aemilia&amp;search%5Bmatch%5D=word-boundary">to linked objects</a></span></div><div class="einsprung">  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/?q=en/node/221">Johannes Lipps, The Basilica Aemilia on the Forum Romanum.
