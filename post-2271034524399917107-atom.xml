During that time, CORONA satellites took high-resolution images of  most of the earth’s surface, with particular emphasis on Soviet bloc  countries and other political hotspots in order to monitor military  sites and produce maps for the Department of Defense.  The more than  800,000 images collected by the CORONA missions remained classified  until 1995 when an executive order by President Bill Clinton made them  publicly available through the  <a href="http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Find_Data/Products_and_Data_Available/Declassified_Satellite_Imagery_-_1" target="_blank">US Geological Survey</a>.   Because CORONA images preserve a high-resolution picture of the world  as it existed in the 1960s, they constitute a unique resource for  researchers and scientists studying environmental change, agriculture,  geomorphology, archaeology and other fields.   <br /><br />In regions like the Middle East, CORONA imagery is particularly  important for archaeology because urban development, agricultural  intensification, and reservoir construction over the past several  decades have obscured or destroyed countless archaeological sites and  other ancient features such as roads and canals.  These sites are often  clearly visible on CORONA imagery, enabling researchers to map sites  that have been lost and to discover many that have never before been  documented.  However, the unique imaging geometry of the CORONA  satellite cameras, which produced long, narrow film strips, makes  correcting spatial distortions in the images very challenging and has  therefore limited their use by researchers.   </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /><br />Thanks to grants from the </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.neh.gov/" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> and the <a href="http://www.acls.org/" target="_blank">American Council of Learned Societies</a>, the <a href="http://www.uark.edu/" target="_blank">University of Arkansas</a>’ Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (<a href="http://cast.uark.edu/" target="_blank">CAST</a>)  has developed methods for efficient orthorectification of CORONA  imagery and now provides free public access to our imagery database for  non-commercial use.  Images can be viewed online and full resolution  images can be downloaded in GeoTiff or NITF formats. <br /><br /><b>IMAGERY</b></span>  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /><br />This project focuses on the Middle East and surrounding regions, areas  where CORONA coverage is abundant and where its value to archaeology and  other fields has been well-demonstrated.  The large majority of the  images we provide come from the KH4B satellites, the latest generation  of CORONA missions in operation from September 1967 through May 1972.   During this time, there were sixteen successful CORONA missions,  designated 1101-1117 which recovered more than 188000 images.  These  satellites were equipped with two panoramic cameras, one facing forward  and another aft with a 30º angle of separation, producing an approximate  ground resolution of 6 feet (1.8m) at nadir as well as offering the  capability for stereo-viewing and the extraction of topographic data.   Images were originally recorded on black-and-white film, copies of which  are curated by the USGS EROS Data Center.  The USGS has scanned the  images at 7 micron (3600 dpi) resolution.  Additional technical details  regarding the CORONA program and image characteristics can be read </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://eros.usgs.gov/#/Guides/disp1" target="_blank">here</a>. <br /><br />Cameras on different CORONA missions produced images that vary a great  deal in quality, while many images suffer from cloud cover, atmospheric  haze or other issues.  For imagery which we purchased, we have  concentrated on providing the greatest possible regional extent, as  opposed to multiple images of the same area, and have also sought to  offer stereo coverage wherever possible.  Imagery purchased for this  project has been supplemented by images purchased for other projects or  those shared with us by colleagues, notably the Center for Archaeology  of the Middle Eastern Landscape (</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/camel/" target="_blank">CAMEL</a>) and the University of Chicago’s <a href="http://oi.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Oriental Institute</a>.   <br /><br />Our work has been largely dedicated to developing methods for  orthorectification of CORONA imagery.  The technical aspects of this  process are described in a forthcoming paper: Jackson Cothren, Jesse Casana, Tuna Kalayci and Adam Barnes, “An  efficient method for rigorous orthorectification of CORONA satellite  imagery” International Journal of Remote Sensing. </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /><br />Images from our database reproduced in publications, presentations or  online should be credited to: Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies,  University of Arkansas/U.S. Geological Survey. </span></blockquote>]]></content>
