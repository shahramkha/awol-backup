   <title type="text">ABO: Annotated Books Online </title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.annotatedbooksonline.com/">ABO: Annotated Books Online</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://www.annotatedbooksonline.com/files/2012/10/logo_120.png" class="decoded" height="84" src="http://www.annotatedbooksonline.com/files/2012/10/logo_120.png" width="200" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">About the project</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">Annotated Books Online is a virtual research environment for scholars  and students interested in historical reading practices. It is part of  the research project “A Collaboratory for the Study of Reading and the  Circulation of Ideas in Early Modern Europe” funded by the Netherlands  Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) and co-ordinated by Arnoud  Visser. Generous additional funding was provided by Anthony Grafton for  the edition of Gabriel Harvey’s annotations to Livy (Mellon Foundation).</span><br /> <h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">Background</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">Proceeding from the idea that reading constitutes a crucial form of  intellectual exchange, the collaborators will collect and enhance  evidence of how readers used their books to build knowledge and  assimilate ideas. This is especially pertinent since the early modern  period, just like the twenty-first century, saw the revolutionary rise  of a new medium of communication, which helped shape cultural formation  and intellectual freedom.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Although widely recognized as a promising approach with important  theoretical implications, currently the study of reading practices still  largely depends on individual researchers, whose work is seriously  hampered by the limited access to an inherently fragmented body of  material. The proposed collaboratory will connect scholarly expertise  and provide added value to digital sources through user-generated  content (e.g. explanatory material or fuller scholarly syntheses) in an  electronic environment specifically designed for research and teaching  purposes. It will offer, in short, an academic Wikipedia for the history  of reading and the circulation of ideas.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: x-small;">The project will create a transnational platform that enables  scholars to (1) view, connect and study annotated books and readers’  notes, (2) offer training to students and young researchers in handling  readers’ traces, and (3) make results freely accessible for teaching  purposes, as well as for broader general interest by means of  exhibitions, digital presentations and general publications. In order to  expand this structural network, the principal partners in the  collaboratory will prepare an application for a Marie Curie Initial  Training Network.</span></blockquote>]]></content>
