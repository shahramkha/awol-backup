   <title type="text">Pelagios Announcement</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/2013/09/pelagios-chapter-3-early-geospatial.html"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Pelagios Chapter 3: Early Geospatial Documents</span></a><br />Monday, 16 September 2013&nbsp;<span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: x-small;">A few weeks ago we trailed that we had some exciting news and now we can finally announce it. Thanks to the generosity of <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>,  Pelagios is entering a third, even more ambitious phase. We will be  extending the Pelagios approach to all early geospatial documents up to  1492 (a game-changing year for the history of cartography). This means  that we'll be dealing with texts and maps, not only from the ancient  Greco-Roman worlds, but also the early Byzantine, Christian, Maritime,  Islamic and Chinese traditions.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/World_map_pietro_vesconte.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="319" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/World_map_pietro_vesconte.jpg" width="320" /></a></span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">With a digital place index of maps and descriptions of the world in  place, researchers and the general public will be able to explore online  the historical significance of both famous and obscure places in the  history of geography. As just one example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_%28Ptolemy%29">Claudius Ptolemy</a> used London as one of his primary reference points for global time  zones in the late second century, just as we do today. While such  coincidences may be rare, and many places in early maps and texts are  unidentified, or existed only in the popular or religious imaginations,  our aim is to help their rich biographies to be told. With such an  unprecedented variety of data linked together, it will be possible to  trace in broad terms the continuities - and discontinuities - of  people's responses to the world around them. Equally exciting, and  thanks to the continuing annotation of data by Pelagios growing  community of partners, you'll also be able to bring together disparate  fragments of its life history, its connections with other places, its  stories and imagery.</span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The project raises significant technological challenges as well. First  of all we will need to make sure that URI-based gazetteers (standardised  lists of places) are available for all of our periods and regions, and  aligned with one another so that they can be cross-referenced. This  means working not only with our old friends at <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a>, but also with new ones at the <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/%7Echgis/">China Historical GIS</a> and <a href="http://www.pastplace.org/">PastPlace</a>.  Then we will need to use a raft of methods, old and new, to identify  toponyms in texts and images, and in a range of languages. Optical  Character Recognition (OCR) – a computer-based method for the automatic  recognition of text in digitized images – is inadequate for use with  medieval handwritten script. Therefore we are developing <a href="http://rsimon.github.com/toponym_identification">new, semi-automatic methods</a>,  which employ image processing and statistical approaches to eliminate  as much of the tedious manual work of transcription as possible. Third,  we will need to relate those place references to the gazetteers,  building on the knowledge and expertise of a network of experts, along  with a few tricks of our own. Places that we can't identify we intend to  throw out to the public, along with any clues we have available, to  invite the wider community to have a go. Finally, we continue to work on  the <a href="http://pelagios.dme.ait.ac.at/api">Pelagios search API</a> and web interface so that the results will become ever easier to work with and incorporate in other digital resources online.</span><br /></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">In addition to the continually growing community of projects providing  content about all these places, we will be working in collaboration with  specialists from all around the world, including from the British  Library, Queen Mary, University of London, KCL, the University of  Portsmouth, the University of Edinburgh, the Orient Institute of Beirut,  the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, Drew University and  Harvard University.
