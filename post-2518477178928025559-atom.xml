   <title type="text">Last Statues of Antiquity</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/">Last Statues of Antiquity (LSA)</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Here you will find a searchable database of the published evidence for  statuary and inscribed statue bases set up after AD 284, that were new,  newly dedicated, or newly re-worked. <br /><br />To access the site, click on one of the buttons above: <a href="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/browse.php" rel="self" title="Browse">BROWSE</a>, <a href="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/simple-search.php" rel="self" title="Simple Search">SIMPLE SEARCH</a>, or <a href="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/database/search3.php" rel="self" title="Advanced Search">ADVANCED SEARCH</a> (or, if you need them, <a href="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/project/instructions.php" rel="self" title="Instructions">INSTRUCTIONS</a>).<br /><br />We  do not have the funding to up-date this resource continuously, but  would welcome hearing of additional material, or of substantive  corrections, by your emailing &lt;<a href="mailto:LSA@classics.ox.ac.uk" rel="self">LSA@classics.ox.ac.uk</a>&gt;.   This database is built on the published work of hundreds of scholars,  whom we hope to have credited fully and correctly; if you are unhappy  with our use of your material, do please contact us.<br /><br />The database  was constructed by a team working partly in Oxford and partly  elsewhere. The person primarily responsible for each entry is named on  each Discussion page, and we would be grateful if you would acknowledge  their work when using their ideas.  For details of the team see <a href="http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk/project/team.php" rel="self" title="Team">the team page</a>.   We suggest that in print you cite individual database entries in the  following way: http://laststatues.classics.ox.ac.uk, LSA-674, LSA-45,  LSA-2013, etc.  (Please note that the LSA number allocated to each entry  is arbitrary, and was determined only by the sequence of cataloguing.)<br /><br />The LSA database was constructed as part of a major project funded by the <a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/" rel="self">Arts and Humanities Research Council</a> of the United Kingdom </span></blockquote>]]></content>
