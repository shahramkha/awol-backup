   <title type="text">New Closed Access Journal: Facts of Life</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://fragments-of-truth.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/academic-publisher-unveils-new-journal.html"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Facts of Life</span></a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Unlike previous closed access journals in which articles are hidden behind a paywall and can be accessed after paying a fee, "<i>Facts of Life</i>"  guarantees that nobody other than the author can access the published  article. This allows scientists to include the article as a published  paper on their CV and cite their work, without ever having&nbsp;to worry that  someone else might read the article. Beer expects that this new concept  will be embraced by many researchers<br /><br />The physician-scientist and poet Yuri Zhivago is among the first  researchers to submit manuscripts to the new journal. "It is a blessing  to have this journal", Zhivago commented, "I have at least three  manuscripts that contain experiments that cannot be replicated. &nbsp;Now I  can publish them without having to worry about my tenure committee  criticizing me for having too few publications. If I published them in  an open access journal, I would eventually have to retract the papers  and this would could damage my reputation as a researcher. By publishing  in "<i>Facts of Life"</i>, I can be sure that nobody will ever be able to accuse me of publishing fraudulent data."<br /><br />Beer is confident that there are many other Zhivagos out there who need a  completely closed-access journal. "We are taking closed access  publishing to a new level and we think that we provide a much-needed  forum for all the researchers want to publish but have no sound data."  She is convinced that other publishers will follow suit when they see  the success of the "completely closed access" model. &nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>]]></content>
