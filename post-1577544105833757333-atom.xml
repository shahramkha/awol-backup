   <title type="text">News from CDLI: Digital capture of the Harvard cuneiform collection</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[Digital capture of the Harvard cuneiform collection<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: 'PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif'; font-size: x-small;"><span><div>We are very  pleased to announce completion of an initial stage of collaboration  between the <a href="http://www.semiticmuseum.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do">Semitic Museum (SM)</a>, Harvard University, and the Andrew W.  Mellon Foundation-supported research project "<a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2010/03/announcement-on-funded-digitisation-of.html">Creating a Sustainable  Digital Cuneiform Library</a>" (CSDCL). Under the general direction of the <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/"> Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative</a> (CDLI - Los Angeles/Berlin), CSDCL  has over the past two years been involved in the digital capture,  persistent archiving and free Internet dissemination of  significant&nbsp;cuneiform&nbsp;collections world-wide.&nbsp;The over 4600 cuneiform  artifacts of the Semitic Museum represent a very significant archive of  texts in a major American collection--indeed, after the collections of  Yale, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago, this  is the fourth largest collection in the US, with, among other  inscriptions of historical interest, a uniquely important group of  legal texts from the middle of the 2nd millennium BC; a set of widely  cited administrative documents from the 24th and 21st centuries BC; and a  still largely unpublished archive from the period of Persian rule over  Babylonia.&nbsp;In furtherance of a collaboration between members of the CDLI  and Harvard academic staff, notably Benjamin Studevent-Hickman, and  with the kind approval of Piotr Steinkeller and the assistance of James  Armstrong, Lance Allred was able to commence scanning of the collection  in May of 2009, and has since made several trips to Cambridge to  continue his work. Following cataloguing, and fatcross-processing and  cleaning of raw files in Los Angeles, initial images were posted to the  CDLI website in July of the same year. While much of Dr. Allred's early  work was dedicated to the capture of the important Nuzi collection of  the SM, subsequent scanning sessions have begun with the systematic  digitization of all texts without regard to their state of publication;  these can now be viewed at <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/collections/harvard/harvard.html" target="1">http://cdli.ucla.edu/collections/harvard/harvard.html</a> or by <a href="http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/cdlisearch/search/">searching the CDLI database</a>.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Since  September of 2009, this cooperation has been under the direct  supervision of James Armstrong's successor, Dr. Adam Aja; with Dr. Aja's  close collaboration, we have been able to reformat to CDLI standards  the Museum's full cuneiform collection catalogue, and he has facilitated  the creation and signing, by legal representatives of the President and  Fellows of Harvard University and the Regents of the University of  California, of an agreement of cooperation between the SM and the CDLI  that went into effect on 23 April of 2010.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>From  the beginning, SM viewed this effort as an opportunity to make available  its cuneiform collection to the world-wide community of web researchers  and informal learners. The agreement between Harvard and UCLA that lays  out the SM/CDLI collaboration is designed to assist cuneiform  specialists in the collation of existing publications, while at the same  time providing general access to tablet images in conjunction with  collated transliterations to lay the broadest possible foundation for  integrative research by the scholarly community. We are confident that  our adherence in this collaboration to the principles of free and open  access best serves all in the Humanities, but particularly in the fields  of dead language research that are dependent on the availability of  primary source materials for their work. In opening to world-wide  inspection cuneiform collections such as that located at Harvard, we  believe, further, that humanists fulfill their curatorial  responsibilities to permanently archive, and to make available to the  public all such artifacts of shared world cultural heritage that are in  their immediate or indirect care.</div></span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif'; font-size: x-small;"><span></span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: 'PrimaSans BT,Verdana,sans-serif'; font-size: x-small;"><span><div>For the Semitic Museum, Harvard University:</div><div>Lawrence E.
