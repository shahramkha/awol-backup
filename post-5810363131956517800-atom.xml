   <title type="text">Open Access Journal: Theban Mapping Project Progress Reports</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.thebanmappingproject.com/about/progress.html">Theban Mapping Project Progress Reports</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=116259103207720939" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">Since its inception in 1978, the Theban Mapping Project (TMP, now  based at the American University in Cairo) has been working to prepare a  comprehensive archaeological database of Thebes. With its thousands of  tombs and temples, Thebes is one of the world's most important  archaeological zones. Sadly, however, it has not fared well over the  years. Treasure-hunters and curio-seekers plundered it in the past;  pollution, rising ground water, and mass-tourism threaten it in the  present. Even early archaeologists destroyed valuable information in  their search for museum-quality pieces.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Today, however, we realize that the monuments of Thebes are a finite  resource. If we fail to protect and monitor them, they will vanish, and  we and our descendants will all be the poorer. The TMP believes that the  first and most essential step in preserving this heritage is a detailed  map and database of every archaeological, geological, and ethnographic  feature in Thebes. Only when these are available can sensible plans be  made for tourism, conservation, and further study.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">During the last decade, the TMP has concentrated on the Valley of the  Kings. Modern surveying techniques were used to measure its tombs. From  the data collected, the TMP is preparing 3-D computer models of the  tombs. And of course, the TMP is continuing its excavation of KV 5. For  the TMP staff, sharing their work with the interested public is just as  important as what they do in the field. This has been done through a  series of publications and this growing website.</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 25px;">See the full&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: 25px;"><a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2012/07/alphabetical-list-of-open-access.html" style="color: #5588aa; text-decoration: none;">List of Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies</a></span></div></div>]]></content>
