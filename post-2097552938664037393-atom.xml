   <title type="text">Open Access Journal: Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal Reader</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://royalasiaticsocietyofbengal.blogspot.com/">Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal Reader</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0h5HZgYKJKY/Ucd0Khibo1I/AAAAAAAAAtM/NTn3X7nKIsc/s1600/FB+header.png" class="decoded" height="125" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0h5HZgYKJKY/Ucd0Khibo1I/AAAAAAAAAtM/NTn3X7nKIsc/s200/FB+header.png" width="200" /> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.midafternoonmap.com/">Afternoon Map</a> is excited to announce its first publication / spinoff website, the <a href="http://royalasiaticsocietyofbengal.blogspot.com/">Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal Reader</a>. Available as a shoddily made <a href="http://royalasiaticsocietyofbengal.blogspot.com/p/pdf-download.html">PDF</a> as well, the Royal Asiatic Reader features highlights from  mid-nineteenth century issues of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic  Society of Bengal that have been digitized by Google Books, with a  particular emphasis on the esoteric, absurd, obscene, mystifying,  offensive and poetic. I've always been fascinated by the articles that  appeared in this Journal, not only because they make such entertaining  reading (if only for the same kinds of people who like to look at old  maps), but also because they seem to so perfectly illustrate the  relationship between geographic knowledge and imperial power so well, if  abstractly, documented in <i>Orientalism</i>. At the same time, while I  hope this collection can serve as an introduction for students knew to  the study of the region, I think it also offers a valuable lesson for  those of us already familiar with the subject. Specifically, the immense  learning that went into much of this writing shows that, rather than  dismiss orientalist scholarship with casual disdain, we should remain  constantly mindful of the fact that scholars much smarter and more hard  working than ourselves have fallen prey to gross ideological biases, and  strive to make sure we don't do the same.</span></blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span><span><span><span><span style="font-family: inherit;">See the full <a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2012/07/alphabetical-list-of-open-access.html">List of Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies</a></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>]]></content>
