Blackwell</a></span></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sean Bonawitz, Neel Smith, and Christopher Blackwell are working during  the summer of 2012 on the first steps of a comprehensive publication of  only surviving witness to the Aristotelian <em>Constitution of the Athenians</em>.  The papyrus is B.M. Pap. 131, that is, British Museum Papyrus number  131. Christopher Blackwell and Amy Hackney Blackwell, working with Chris  Lee of the British Library, photographed this papyrus in November of  2011. The work was funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant  No. EAGER–1041949. The images of the papyrus are undergoing automated  analysis using new algorithms developed by Dr. Constantin Papaodysseus  of the National Technical Institute of Athens. This summer’s work is  being supported by the <a href="http://www2.furman.edu/sites/ur/Pages/FurmanAdvantage.aspx">Furman Advantage Program</a>.<br /><br />The papyrus exists in five fragments. The five fragments show four  different manuscript hands. The hands differ in appearance and in their  use of abbreviations. According to </span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Qpru7GSUP9EC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">John Edward Sandy’s 1893 commentary, pp. xxxvi–xxxix,</a>,  the first hand “extends over Columns 1–12” the second columns 13 to 20,  the third hand runs from 20 to 24 and columns 31–37, while the fourth  scribe includes columns from 25 to 30. Hands one and four are most  similar to each other, but certainly not identical; Sandy’s came to this  conclusion by counting the occurrence of abbreviations. While the first  and fourth scribes used a significant amount of short-hand  (“tachygraphy”) and abbreviations, the second hand hardly uses any, and  in the columns written by the third hand they are scarce. Perhaps the  most important thing about the change of hands are the editorial notes  that occur throughout the piece. Who was this editor, and why did he  make these notes?<br /><br /><a href="http://folio.furman.edu/projects/AthPol/AthPolImages.html">Images of the papyrus are here</a></span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">.&nbsp; <span class="post-author vcard"><span class="fn"></span></span><span class="post-timestamp"><a class="timestamp-link" href="http://furman-classics.blogspot.com/2012/07/british-library-papyrus-of-constitution.html" itemprop="url" rel="bookmark" title="permanent link"><abbr class="published" itemprop="datePublished" title="2012-07-16T07:04:00-07:00"></abbr></a></span></span></blockquote>]]></content>
