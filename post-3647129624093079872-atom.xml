Schiffman</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><h2><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Jews in Late Antiquity</span></h2><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Hellenistic period begins formally with Alexander’s arrival in  the Near East in 334 B.C.E. However, this date should not be seen as the  beginning of Hellenistic influence in this region. The Near East as a  whole and the Land of Israel and its Jewish residents more particularly  were subject to increasing Aegean influence beginning already in the  fourteenth century B.C.E. Due to increased trade connections, this  influence became much more extensive during the Persian period when  Greek coinage became the standard in the Land of Israel.

By the time the period of Late Antiquity drew to a close,  Judaism had survived the challenges of Hellenization, sectarianism,  violent revolution, and even anti-Semitism. In addition, the development  of Israelite religion into the rabbinic tradition took place in these  very same years. The many transitions that took place in this period are  what effectively made possible the long-term continuity of Judaism as  an exilic religion, able to enter the medieval period with a new  consensus on how to face the future and explain the past.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Click here to download or read online: <a href="http://lawrenceschiffman.com/second-temple-and-rabbinic-judaism.PDF">Challenge and Transformation: Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism</a></span></blockquote>]]></content>
