   <content type="html"><![CDATA[In a communication to agade: <br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">CDLN 2011:005 <br />Sara Brumfield: <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdln/archives/000018.html">Two Early Dynastic Capacity Standards</a><br /><br />CDLN 2011:006 <br />Robert K. Englund: <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdln/archives/000019.html">Notes on KIDa</a>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />The CDLN has recently changed its publication practices. New submissions will appear in preprint status four times a year (January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1; notices of new submissions will be made to this list). During the preprint period, authors will be able to make small, non-substantive changes (e.g. typographical errors) to their submissions. After two weeks, these submissions are then archived. <br /><br />The <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlninfo.html">CDLN</a>, together with its sister publications <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlb.html">Cuneiform DigitalLibrary Bulletin (CDLB)</a> and <a href="http://cdli.ucla.edu/pubs/cdlj.html">Cuneiform Digital Library Journal (CDLJ)</a>, are peer-reviewed publications that offer a persistent web presence under the auspices of the University of California system. As e-journals, the delay between submission and publication is well below that of academic print journals, while the interaction with cuneiform artifacts documented in the CDLI database offers obvious strengths for an interactive and discourse. Authors should expect a two to four month interval between submission of a draft text with illustrations and its publication for substantive contributions to the CDLJ, at most two months for those made to the Bulletin, and approximately two weeks for the Notes that are conceived as an online venue for NABU-style communications that can include short philological or lexicographical contributions as well as regular updates of a more substantial nature describing the background or progress of, in particular, web-based research efforts. <br /><br />Scholars are encouraged to send contributions to the CDLN at allred at ucla dot edu.</span></blockquote>]]></content>
