   <title type="text">Happy 20th Birthday to BMCR</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[Happy twentieth birthday to <a href="http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/">Bryn Mawr Classical Review</a>, the mother of all open access journals in Ancient studies.<br /><br /><i><a href="http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2010/2010-11-51.html">BMCR's 20th Anniversary posting</a></i><br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">The first issue of <i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i> was released for  internet distribution twenty years ago today.  We thank our many  colleagues who have joined in the editorial process, our very many  colleagues who have reviewed for us, and our many, many readers and  friends over the years.  There were only a handful of "e-journals" back  then, and the only journal in the humanities that is senior to us by a  few weeks is <i>Postmodern Culture</i>. We are one of the oldest (if not  indeed the very oldest) e-journals to offer complete "open access" (in  the jargon that has evolved since), that is, we have made every word of  our publication freely available over the net from the first day.  We  are particularly grateful to another (overlapping!) set of colleagues  and friends who have helped produce and make use of our textbook series,  Bryn Mawr Commentaries, on whose revenues BMCR depends for its free  distribution.  (When you assign a <a href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/classics/commentaries.html">Bryn Mawr Commentary</a>, in other words, you support BMCR.)</span> </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">If you lift a glass in our honor on this anniversary, savor as you do  the irony that this grave and senior pioneer of electronic publishing  is devoted to chronicling and assessing the publication of the printed  book. We do not prophesy the future, when e-books and p-books settle  their relations with one another.  But we persist.</span> </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"> James J. O'Donnell</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Richard Hamilton</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Camilla MacKay</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rolando Ferri</span></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ancientworldonline.blogspot.com/2009/10/alphabetical-list-of-open-access.html"> List&nbsp; of the 795 Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies which have appeared since BMCR began.</a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a expr:id="data:post.url" expr:name="data:post.title" href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=116259103207720939" onclick="return addthis_sendto()" onmouseout="addthis_close()" onmouseover="return addthis_open(this, &quot;&quot;, this.id, this.name);"><img alt="Bookmark and Share so Your Real Friends Know that You Know" height="16" src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/lg-share-en.gif" style="border: 0pt none;" width="125" /></a></div><br /><br /><script src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js?pub=xa-4a3fbb0e7571e986" type="text/javascript"></script>]]></content>
