   <title type="text">Rock Art Studies: A Bibliographic Database</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart.html">Rock Art Studies: A Bibliographic Database</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/rockart.gif" class="decoded" height="45" src="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/rockart.gif" width="320" />&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart/search.html">Rock Art Studies: A Bibliographic Database</a> is a compilation in progress which was begun in March, 1993. Currently  the database contains over 27,000 citations to the world's rock art  literature, with an emphasis on English language and North American  citations. Over 9500 of these citations are held in the compiler's  personal library. These and many others were reviewed for annotation.  With the "r11" release, the database became available on the Internet as  a project of the Bay Area Rock Art Research Association Archive,  Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley (<a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart.html">http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart.html</a>).</span><br /><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">A few comments regarding the background and objectives of the  Compiler, and the assembly of the raw data for inclusion in the database  are in order. Leigh Marymor, is a Plumbing Contractor from Berkeley,  California who holds a bachelor's degree in Community Education from the  University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. He has been interested in rock art  conservation and the literature of rock art studies for over  thirty-five years. He served as President of the American Rock Art  Research Association (2004-2006), is a co-founder of the Bay Area Rock  Art Research Association and has been its Co-chairperson since its  inception in 1983. Leigh Marymor received the American Rock Art Research  Association's Castleton Award for research excellence in 2002 in  recognition of the significance of the compilation of Rock Art Studies: A  Bibliographic Database.</span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">The Rock Art Studies database was initially conceived as a tool  useful in cataloging the rock art literature held in the Compiler's  personal library, which currently consists of approximately 100 shelf  feet of books, periodicals, grey literature, ephemera and research  notes. As the project grew, additional citations were included from over  one hundred additional sources, including: bibliographies, research  archives, library catalogues, on-line search services and other private  holdings (these sources are notated in the "library" field of the  database, and are detailed in the text document, Key to Sources for  Citations). </span><br />  <span style="font-size: x-small;">The scope of the data included in the database has been limited by  the time and energy available to the Compiler, as well as, by his  subjective approach to keyword notations (found in the Keywords field).  The past emphasis in the database on English language literature has  steadily given way to the growing inclusion of the French, Spanish,  Italian and Portuguese literature.</span><br /><br />        <span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="" src="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/arrow.gif" /><a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart/barara.html">Bay Area Rock Art Research Association Archive</a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="" src="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/arrow.gif" /><a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart/barara.html#assoc">Bay Area Rock Art Research Association</a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="" src="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/arrow.gif" /><a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart/barara.html#conserve">Bay Area Rock Art Conservation and Education Fund</a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="" src="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/arrow.gif" /><a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart/search.html">Search the Rock Art Studies database</a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="" src="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/arrow.gif" /><a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart/citation.html">Citation information</a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="" src="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/arrow.gif" /><a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart/links.html">Related Links</a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img alt="" src="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/images/arrow.gif" /><a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/rockart/contact.html">Contact the Compiler</a></span></blockquote>]]></content>
