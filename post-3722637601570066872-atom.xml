   <title type="text">Libyan Archaeological Sites from Pleiades in Google Earth</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://archaeological.org/news/aianews/4604">Libyan Archaeological Sites&nbsp;</a><br /><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="authdate">April 3, 2011  | by Peter Herdrich&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="authdate">  </span></span>       <br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">  The Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) and the US Committee of  the Blue Shield (USCBS) call on the international community to protect  the ancient sites and antiquities of Libya, which are now facing very  real threats of damage and destruction caused by the civil unrest and  military action taking place there.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">  While our thoughts are primarily for the safety of the people harm’s  way, the cultural heritage and archaeological resources located in Libya  are irreplaceable elements of the world’s shared memory, going back  thousands of years. The importance of guarding these treasures while  military operations are underway cannot be overestimated.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">  In this context information is essential, particularly up to date  knowledge of the locations of cultural heritage and archaeological  sites. We have posted this map to provide locations of sites in Libya  and to illustrate just how close so many are to the danger.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><div style="text-align: center;">  <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=http:%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fsearch_kml%3FSearchableText%3D%26Title%3D%26Subject_usage%253Aignore_empty%3D%26Description%3D%26lowerLeft%3D9.3870%252C19.5080%26upperRight%3D25.1506%252C33.1690%26predicate%3Dintersection%26tolerance%3D0.0%26limit%3D1%26location_precision%253Alist%3Dprecise%26created%253Alist%253Adate%3D1970%252F02%252F01%26created_usage%3Drange%253Amin%26portal_type%253Alist%3DPlace%26Creator%3D%26review_state%253Alist%3Dpublished%26submit%3DSearch&amp;aq=&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=73.666674,136.40625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=29.53523,17.336426&amp;spn=20.797643,34.101563" style="color: blue; text-align: left;" target="_blank">View Map</a></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">  Put together by <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/" target="_blank">Pleiades</a>,  a collaborative project funded by the National Endowment for the  Humanities that is mapping ancient sites around the Mediterranean and  beyond, the link shows sites throughout Libya. You will see that many  are located along the Mediterranean coast, where much of the conflict is  taking place. While not all of the points on it have been confirmed as  the precise location of the sites they indicate, the Pleiades map is an  excellent presentation of the extent of cultural heritage found in the  country.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">  The AIA and US Blue Shield encourage all organizations, academies,  scholars, and others committed to the preservation of antiquities  worldwide to repost the map on their own websites, to share this  information with their own constituencies, and to point out the threat  to sites. The map is released under a Creative Commons license and is  reusable so long as Pleiades is cited.
