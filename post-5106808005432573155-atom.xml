   <title type="text">The Friedberg Genizah Project (FGP) Version 10</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.genizah.org/">The Friedberg Genizah  Project (FGP)</a><br /><br />Email update: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Friedberg Genizah Project<br />November 12, 2012<br />Announcement No. 12</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Dear User,</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />"Genazim" is pleased to announce the launching of Version 10 of the<br />Genizah website.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Following is an overview of the improvements in this version.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />A. Images<br />1. Cambridge<br />With great satisfaction we announce the recent successful completion (on<br />time!) of the complex project of digitizing the entire Genizah collection<br />of the Cambridge University Library, a project designed and planned in<br />cooperation with the Genizah Research Unit of CUL, and implemented<br />by CUL Each fragment of the CUL Genizah was digitized and is<br />currently displayed on the website. We are now in the process of applying<br />a final comprehensive check to verify that indeed all of the Genizah<br />fragments have been digitized, and that no image is missing from our<br />website.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />2. Birmingham<br />The Genizah collection in the Birmingham Library – including its two<br />sub-collections Mingana and Mittwoch – has been digitized in its entirety<br />and is now displayed on the website. Our sincere thanks to the Library<br />staff for their generous cooperation in this task.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />3. Manchester<br />Genazim is glad to report that an agreement has been reached with the<br />Manchester University Library, according to which FGP will receive a<br />copy of the high-quality images of its entire Genizah collection, together<br />with a copy of all the appropriate metadata and cataloging details<br />available there. The metadata were already received and are now being<br />processed for integration in the website; the images are expected to be<br />received here very soon.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />We wish to thank the Library and all the Officers and the technical<br />support persons in charge for their cooperation spirit, their support and<br />their good will in bringing this important initiative to its happy end.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />B. "Ginzei Kedem"<br />All the 8 volumes of "Ginzei Kedem" – a Journal devoted to Genizah<br />research and published by the Ben-Zvi Institute - can now be viewed as<br />PDF files in the website, and can be searched (in a specific volume or in<br />all volumes together) for a word, and the appropriate results will be<br />displayed. These functions may be operated by clicking on "Ginzei<br />Kedem" on the bottom part of the website Homepage.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />C. Software</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />1. Physical attributes of a Fragment<br />With the display of an image, it is possible now to see important data on<br />the physical attributes of that fragment, such as external and internal<br />dimensions, number of lines, margin width, average height of a line,<br />density of the text and more, as recently computed automatically by<br />Genazim software for almost all Genizah images , by clicking on the icon<br />that is found in the list of icons above the image.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />This function is presently operational for shelfmarks that contain only a<br />single folio fragment, and it will be extended to all images in the near<br />future.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />2. Search on Computerized Data of a fragment's physical attributes<br />Until now it was possible to combine in the advanced search the physical<br />attributes of a fragment, such as dimensions, number of lines, and more,<br />as long as they existed in the catalog record of the corresponding<br />shelfmark. With the new version, the user can extend the search to take<br />into account also these attributes when they were automatically computed<br />by the system.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />3. Filter Mechanism<br />For efficiency and simplicity reasons, the default in the filter mechanism<br />is now "No Filter", as opposed to the status that existed till now.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />4. Various Fixes and Enhancements<br />A number of software bugs that appeared very rarely were fixed, and a<br />number of small enhancements were introduced that will not be detailed<br />here but which the user will notice during his work.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />As usual, remarks and suggestions would be most welcome.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Genazim</span></blockquote>]]></content>
