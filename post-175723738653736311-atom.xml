   <title type="text">Avestan Digital Archive (ADA)</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<span style="font-size: xx-small;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">[First posted in AWOL 26 July 2012. Updated 1 December 2012]</span></span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.avesta-archive.com/">Avestan Digital Archive (ADA)</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://ada.usal.es/img/headermaslargo.jpg" class="decoded" src="http://ada.usal.es/img/headermaslargo.jpg" /> </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Avestan Digital Archive (ADA) seeks to be a digital archive  containing     all Avestan manuscripts spread all over the world. The Avesta, the  holy     book of the Zoroastrian religion, was last edited at the end of the  90s     of the 19th century by the German scholar K. F. Geldner. We claim      that presently a new edition is needed. The main reasons are: </span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">In the last decades some manuscripts Geldner did not have access to  have become available</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Geldner did not check by himself all the manuscripts used for his  edition. For some of them he had access only to copies or collations by  other colleagues. This was the source of several mistakes in his edition</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">the methods of textual criticism have strongly changed since  Geldner and many methodological decisions of Geldner seem today  unacceptable. The most important one is undoubtedly that he does not  record systematically all the variae lectiones (or a selection according  to well established criteria), but only the variants he considered  important for the establishment of a sure text</span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;">even when he checked the manuscript by himself and recorded the  variae lectiones, he made mistakes more often than expected</span></li></ul><span style="font-size: x-small;"> For all these reasons it has become a true need to provide the  scholars with reasonably sure readings of the extant Avestan texts. But a  new edition of the Avesta is a huge task: probably more than two  hundred manuscripts scattered all over the world have to be checked.  Many of them are not available even as microfilms and are only  accessible through long stays in Indian libraries. Also the purchase of  microfilms from European libraries is not the best way for single  researchers to get access to the manuscripts: a lot of them are needed,  so that the undertaking quickly gets too expensive and the result is a  not easily manageable amount of microfilms. A printed publication of such an amount of manuscripts is no more  feasible, above all because of financial reasons. So it is easy to  understand that yet nobody has seriously tried to undertake a new  edition of the Avesta, or al least a serious review of Geldner's  edition.</span> </blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;">In order to solve this problem we have conceived the ADA project.  This project seeks, on the one side, to find, to collect and to  digitalize all the extant Avestan manuscripts. On the other hand, the  ADA Project is developing a tool to provide all these manuscripts with  indexes of the passages and to make them thus available on the web for  researchers and for the general public. The electronic tool will allow  an easy checking of all the manuscripts containing a concrete passage.  This research tool can be useful not only for the Old Iranian studies,  but also for the textual criticism based on manuscripts in other  languages and fields  of research. Furthermore, the ADA project seeks to review the manuscript  transmission of the Avestan texts in all its aspects, a task which  presupposes the complete ga thering and availability of the manuscripts. </span></blockquote><blockquote><div id="sidebar1"><div class="menuitem"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://ada.usal.es/paginas/buscador_obra">Manuscripts view</a></span></div><div class="menuitem"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://ada.usal.es/pages/libraries_mrl">Libraries</a></span></div><div class="menuitem"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://ada.usal.es/pages/transmission_index">Avestan  written transmission</a></span></div><div class="menuitem"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://ada.usal.es/paginas/search">Search</a></span></div><div class="menuitem"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://ada.usal.es/pages/newsletter">ADA-Newsletter</a></span></div><div class="menuitem"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://ada.usal.es/pages/conference_index">Conference</a></span></div><div class="menuitem"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><a href="http://ada.usal.es/analizador">Tools for  Avestan Text Criticism</a></span></div></div></blockquote><div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=116259103207720939" id="data:post.url" name="data:post.title" onclick="return addthis_sendto()" onmouseout="addthis_close()" onmouseover="'return"></a></div><script src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js?pub=xa-4a3fbb0e7571e986" type="text/javascript"></script></div>]]></content>
