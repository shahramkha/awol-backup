Brian Rose    </span></span>  </p>      <p>  <span style="font-size:85%;"><img alt="" src="http://www.archaeological.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/med_thumbnail/BrianRose.jpg" style="width: 154px; height: 200px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; float: left;" />When the Archaeological Institute of  America (AIA) was established in 1879, the telephone was in its infancy  and the radio was still a decade or more away. Inventors such as Bell,  Tesla, and Marconi revolutionized how we communicated in the late 19th  century, but even greater steps were made in the late 1930s, with the  advent of television, and 1940s, with digital computers. During this  time, the AIA reached out to the public through lectures and, beginning  in 1948, with ARCHAEOLOGY magazine. But even then, the power of “new”  media was apparent, for example in the popularity of the 1950s  television series “What in the World?” featuring artifacts, curators,  and celebrities.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">  Now when we talk of “new” media, however, we generally mean Web-based  stories, audio files, video, and the like. The Web itself arose in the  mid-1990s, soon after which both ARCHAEOLOGY and the AIA had established  sites. Today, we are taking another step in bringing the ancient world  to the public, and to professional AIA Members, as we re-launch the AIA  website.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size:85%;">  Our staff in Boston has spent many hours on this project, guided by Eti  Bonn-Muller, the AIA’s Manager of Online Communications (and  ARCHAEOLOGY’s Online Senior Editor) and Web Designer Amélie Walker of  Castle Builder Design. We hope you will find the site more user-friendly  than before and even more informative about AIA’s mission, programs,  and Membership benefits. Please take some time to explore our new  site—and let us know what you think: <a href="http://www.archaeological.org/comment/reply/318#comment-form">leave comments and suggestions  below</a>.</span></p></div></div></blockquote><!-- AddThis Button BEGIN --><div><a name="data:post.title" id="data:post.url" onmouseover="'return" onmouseout="addthis_close()" onclick="return addthis_sendto()"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/lg-share-en.gif" alt="Bookmark and Share so Your Real Friends Know that You Know" style="border: 0pt none;" height="16" width="125" /></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js?pub=xa-4a3fbb0e7571e986"></script></div><!-- AddThis Button END -->]]></content>
