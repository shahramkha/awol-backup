   <title type="text">Online Classical Timeline</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.classicalstudiesonline.org/">Classical Timeline:&nbsp; An Interactive Guide Through the People, Events and Ideas of Classical Antiquity</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[Please note: ClassicalTimeline is currently a new venture (the beta  version was launched on 07 May 2012), and, though additions will be  added with increasing frequency, we ask patience while it might seem  sparse in its content and sporadic in its focus.]</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">ClassicalTimeline is an online educational resource that seeks to  introduce its visitors to the key people, events and ideas of Classical  antiquity. By providing an interactive timeline that features both text  and video resources, users of the website have a unique opportunity to  gain an easy purview over the span and narrative of Classical history,  while also being able to select more detailed information on areas that  are of particular interest to them. While the timeline’s contents range  across the length of Classical history, supplementary timelines  detailing several complex events from antiquity (e.g. the Punic Wars,  the fall of the Roman Republic etc…) are to be added at a later date.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">We are an independent organization and do not receive funding from  any organization, group or academic institution. Our continuing  existence depends upon the distribution of time, knowledge and financial  support being given from those who have a passion for Classical history  and a desire to infuse people with a love and&nbsp;familiarity&nbsp;of the  subject. We take every measure to ensure that our entries are accurate,  and editors (listed below) are assigned to help supervise the accuracy  of entries that fall within their academic speciality. Attempting though  to catalogue the span of classical antiquity and highlight it most  notable events and people &nbsp;is a daunting undertaking, and we warmly  welcome comments, criticism and suggestions.</span></blockquote>]]></content>
