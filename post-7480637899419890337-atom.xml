   <title type="text">Online Exhibition: God's Regents on Earth: A Thousand Years of Byzantine Imperial Seals</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals">God's Regents on Earth: A Thousand Years of Byzantine Imperial Seals</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><img alt="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals/@@images/ba059bb6-54c6-475d-a225-0b0f355c2f51.jpeg" class="decoded" src="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals/@@images/ba059bb6-54c6-475d-a225-0b0f355c2f51.jpeg" />&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;">For over a thousand years the Byzantine Emperor sat in his palace,  ruling over the empire as God’s regent on earth. His was the ultimate  authority. The emperor was the font of all law, granter of titles and  offices, distributer of largess, master of the Church, commander of the  army, head of the bureaucracy, and supreme judge. The decisions of the  individual who sat on the throne had repercussions throughout the Byzantine  world and far beyond. Decrees, letters, judgments, and commands left  Constantinople every day signed by the emperor in red ink and secured  with the imperial seal. These seals not only protected and authenticated  imperial documents, they also spread the emperor’s image and served as  imperial propaganda. It is no accident that while one emperor chose to  be depicted as a soldier, another chose to be shown as a civilian.  Although Christ accompanies one emperor, another might choose St.  Constantine, or the Mother of God, or perhaps simply the cross. Was his  title Greek, <i>basileus,</i> or Latin, <i>augustus</i>? Did he want to emphasise his family as an imperial asset or assert his position as <i>autokrator</i>,  the sole ruler of God’s empire on earth? The designs of the imperial  seals are interesting for more than their artistic value, they provide  an insight into the minds and policies of the rulers whose image they  bore; they tell us not only how they wished to be viewed by the  recipients of their letters, but also how they viewed themselves.  Imperial seals, with their titles, images, and projection of divinely  sanctioned authority, show the blend of Roman, Hellenistic, and  Judaeo-Christian ingredients that went into the Byzantine imperial  recipe.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This exhibition presents the imperial lead seals from the Dumbarton  Oaks Collection. Sections include: a chronology of the rulers of  Byzantium exploring the design and inscriptions of their seals and  presenting brief biographies; an analysis of the development of imperial  titulature; the iconographic choices made by usurpers; and finally a  section on seals that show or reference the imperial family. We hope  that after visiting this exhibit you will be inspired to explore the  online catalogue of Byzantine seals in the Dumbarton Oaks collection.  This project was begun in 2010, and is continually updated as more seals  from our collection of 17,000 are catalogued.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp; <span class="portletTopRight"></span></span>    <br /><div class="exhibit-sections"><br /><dd class="portletItem"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="section-rulers-of-byzantium" href="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals/rulers-of-byzantium" title="">                    Rulers of Byzantium                 </a></span>            </dd>            <dd class="portletItem"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="section-imperial-dynasties" href="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals/imperial-dynasties" title="Keeping it in the family">                    Dynasties of Empire                 </a></span>            </dd>            <dd class="portletItem"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="section-not-born-in-the-purple-interlopers-and-usurpers" href="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals/not-born-in-the-purple-interlopers-and-usurpers" title="Born Outside the Purple">                    Interlopers and Usurpers                 </a></span>            </dd>            <dd class="portletItem"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="section-divine-guardians" href="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals/divine-guardians" title="The Court of Heaven">                    Divine Guardians                 </a></span>            </dd>            <dd class="portletItem"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="section-imperial-titulature" href="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals/imperial-titulature" title="What's in a Name?">                    Imperial Titulature                 </a></span>            </dd>        </div><div class="exhibit-pages"><br /><dd class="portletItem"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="page-explore-exhibit" href="http://www.doaks.org/resources/seals/gods-regents-on-earth-a-thousand-years-of-byzantine-imperial-seals/explore-exhibit" title="">                    Browse &amp; Explore                 </a></span>            </dd>        </div><br /></blockquote>]]></content>
