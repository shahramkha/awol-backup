   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://theotheracropolis.com/">theotheracropolis.com</a><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: black; font-size: x-small;">This photoblog is the first stage of a series of projects by <i>The Other Acropolis Collective</i>.  We have a background in archaeology, anthropology, or media studies,  and we all share a desire to intervene critically in the processes that  often result in monolithic and exclusivist archaeological and heritage  materialities in the present.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our aim is&nbsp; to produce a range of  alternative media interventions which will take the iconic site of the  Athenian Acropolis as their centre, their point of departure, or their  target (in all senses of the word). This project is a follow-up from a  number of other, more conventional academic projects, to do with issues  such as the role of the Acropolis in nationalist and colonialist  discourses and practices, the social, political, and sensual lives of  its ruins, the ways by which the transformative power of archaeological  and photographic apparatuses have produced and endlessly reproduced the  site/sight of the Acropolis, the tourist experience of the site, and so  on (see bibliography for some of these projects).</span><br /><br /> <span style="color: black; font-size: x-small;">This project can be seen as the  attempt to undermine the monolithic discourse on the Acropolis as an  exclusively classical site, by bringing into the fore its other lives,  from prehistory to the present (the Mycenaean, the Medieval, the  Ottoman, the Muslim, the Christian, the contemporary…), especially  through their material traces that still survive, despite the extensive  processes of archaeological, but also photographic purification.&nbsp; We  draw our inspiration from two concepts: the first is multi-temporality,  and the second, multi-sensoriality.&nbsp; We believe that the site and the  space around it constitute a unique locale which can re-activate  different times, evoke different cultures, and reconnect with diverse  and fluid identities. At the same time, we hope to encourage a fully  embodied, multi-sensory appreciation and engagement with the materiality  of the site, beyond the stereotypical, tourist gaze, or the national  pilgrimage. &nbsp;We also favour the re-incorporation of this locale into the  fabric of daily life, especially for the people who live around it. We  hope that the thoughts and the material generated here will lead to  other projects and interventions, some on site, some printed, some  virtual, with more immediate a printed, portable alternative tourist  guide for <i>The Other Acropolis</i>. We invite you to post your  comment, share your thoughts, and if you are an artist or a researcher  already working on a similar project, get in touch with us.</span></blockquote></div>]]></content>
