   <title type="text">Online Exhibition: Roads of Arabia</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.roadsofarabia.com/">Roads of Arabia: Archaeology and History of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">    Over the last forty years... archaeologists working in Saudi  Arabia have been uncovering sites across the peninsula, revealing an  ancient past for which there is scant literary testimony and hitherto no  tangible evidence. This exhibition, <i>Roads of Arabia</i>, can open  all our eyes, as it includes well over three hundred objects that date  from prehistoric times to the birth of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in  1932. It offers, then, a window on the peninsula’s pre-Islamic past and  on the axis of the entire Muslim community, the Holy Shrine of the Ka`ba  in Mecca. </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">        Mysterious stone steles, monumental statues of humans, haunting gold  masks, and bronze statuettes of Roman gods testify to Arabia’s rich and  complex history before the coming of Islam. None of the works had been  seen outside of Saudi Arabia until 2010, when the Saudi Commission for  Tourism and Antiquities (SCTA) in collaboration with the Musée du Louvre  organized the first exhibition of the material. Other venues in Europe  included the CaixaForum in Barcelona, the Hermitage Museum in St.  Petersburg, and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. We at the Smithsonian’s  Arthur M. Sackler Gallery are delighted to be the first US venue for <i>Roads of Arabia</i>, and also to serve as the organizer of its North American tour. </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">        The objects selected for <i>Roads of Arabia</i> demonstrate that the  Arabian Peninsula was not isolated in ancient times. Arabia acted as  the conduit for the spices and incense from its southern coast and the  Horn of Africa that supplied the temples and royal courts of the Middle  East and the Mediterranean. This lucrative trade encouraged the  development of a network of oases linked by caravan trails that  traversed the peninsula, which was thus connected to the great  metropolitan centers of the Ancient Near East—Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia,  and Iran—and the Greco-Roman world. Many of the excavated sites reveal a  cultural efflorescence, with objects imported from abroad and objects  created locally that witness the strength of local and regional  ideologies and aesthetics...</blockquote>]]></content>
