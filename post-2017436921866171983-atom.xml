Each issue will be dedicated to its own topic,    often with  guest editors, for an in-depth exploration of important    current  problems in the field of Classics. We hope that <i>Classics@</i> will  appeal not only to professional classicists, but also to the     intellectually curious who are willing to enter the conversation in our     discipline. We hope that they find that classical scholarship engages     issues of great significance to a wide range of cultural and  scholarly    concerns and does so in a rigorous and challenging way.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Each issue of <i>Classics@</i> is meant to be not static but  dynamic, continuing to evolve with    interaction from its readers as  participants. New issues will appear    when the editors think there is  good material to offer. Often it will    emphasize work done in and  through the Center for Hellenic Studies, but    it will also call  attention to fresh and interesting work presented    elsewhere on the  web. It stresses the importance of    research-in-progress, encouraging  collegial debate (while discouraging    polemics for the sake of  polemics) as well as the timely sharing of    important new information</span>.<br /><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Issue 11</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=5139">Issue 11: The Rhetoric of Abuse in Greek Literature</a>.  This volume grew out of the need for a venue in which to engage  collaboratively on the topic of abuse. Abuse has of course been widely  studied, and in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in  abuse as a broader cultural and literary phenomenon, but there are  reasonable restrictions as to how it has been addressed. One goal of  this volume is to initiate a scholarly discussion that will allow  greater heterogeneity in the material covered and in the theoretical  models brought to bear on that material. Another is to encourage  experimentation and collaborative exchange among scholars working in  seemingly unconnected fields. Most importantly, perhaps, we would like  to foster a deeper understanding of the role of abuse in all of Greek  literature, across genres and time periods, through the kind of  cumulative knowledge that comes from collaborative work in different  fields.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Issue 10</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=4871"> Issue 10: Historical Poetics in Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Greece: Essays in Honor of Lily Macrakis</a>.  History needs art to give it form; art needs history to give it  resonance. This relationship of history and art is the theme of the  essays by distinguished international scholars collected in this volume.  Its publication celebrates the career and work of Professor Lily  Macrakis. She is an eminent chronicler of modern Greek history whose  seminal work, <em>Venizelos: A Study in Cretan Leadership</em><span>,  remains essential to an understanding of the most influential Greek  leader of the 20th century. Among her other accomplishments, Professor  Macrakis was president of The Modern Greek Studies Association from 1977  to 1979 and has been an influential figure in the organization since  its inception. Equally significant has been her role as a devoted  teacher of Greek history and culture to multitudes of students.  Professor Macrakis thus truly embodies the spirit and significance of  the articles presented in this Festschrift so fittingly dedicated to  her.</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Issue 9</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=4026">Issue 9: Defense Mechanisms in Interdisciplinary Approaches to Classical Studies and Beyond</a>.  Nowadays people speak of “defense mechanisms” as both negative and  positive forms of behavior: examples of negative forms are denial,  repression, acting out, projection, rationalization,  intellectualization, while one of the few positive forms is assertion, a  way of responding that takes the middle ground between aggressive and  passive. In the spirit of this positive form of assertion and in both  technical and non-technical senses of the expression “defense  mechanisms,” the present issue of Classics@ has been given its title.  The aim is to publish online research papers and essays in Classics and  in other disciplines, related or unrelated, that explore strategies  where the primary purpose is to defend assertively rather than attack.  The justification is straightforward: discoveries and discovery  procedures in research require and deserve a reasoned defense.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Issue 8</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Issue 8: A Homer commentary in progress, eds.

This volume is the first collection of essays in English devoted to  discussion of the newly-recovered Sappho poem and two other incomplete  texts on the same papyri. Containing eleven new essays by leading  scholars, it addresses a wide range of textual and philological issues  connected with the find. Using different approaches, the contributions  demonstrate how the "New Sappho" can be appreciated as a gracefully  spare poetic statement regarding the painful inevitability of death and  aging.

Skinner.</span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"></span><h3><span style="font-size: x-small;">Issue 3</span></h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=ArticleWrapper&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=1307"> Issue 3: The Homerizon: Conceptual Interrogations in Homeric Studies</a> is the result of a colloquium held at the Center.
