   <title type="text">Gershom Scholem's Zoharic Lexicon Card Catalogue Online</title>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/scholem-card-catalog/Pages/default.aspx">Scholem Card Index</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Zohar is among the preeminent  spiritual works of all time. Its history attests to its importance:  within three hundred years of its creation (at the end of the 13th  century) it had become the central text Kabbalistic text. The Kabbalists  regarded it as an authoritative source, a model to be emulated, and an  interpretive subject.&nbsp; Gershom Scholem (1897-1982), the father of  Kabbalah scholarship, followed suit and made the Zohar the focus of his  endeavors.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />Scholem's words about various  passages, verses and words from the Zohar can be found in the many  notations he made in his copy of the Zohar, on notes that he tucked  between its pages, which were published in facsimile in 1991/2<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> as well as in his Milon HaZohar card index, which is now available on the National Library's website.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />The catalogue is not a book per se,  but personal notes that Scholem took in anticipation of the future  writing of a Zohar lexicon. The notes are in the form of white cards,  which Scholem stored in impeccable order in a long narrow wooden drawer  that fit them perfectly, in his impressive writing desk (which today  serves as the Scholem collections librarian's desk at the National  Library). Each card deals with a word from the Zohar and includes  citations that include this word in its various senses, with references  to the Zohar, clarifications of formulation and important notes on the  lexicon of the Zohar.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />The notes written on the cards  include, first and foremost, the meaning of the word and its various  connotations, both in linguistic and Kabbalistic terms, and sometimes  also symbolic ones.&nbsp; In addition, the cards contain other usages and  explanations that elucidate the origin of the word and it etymological  development from the ancient texts (Bible, Talmud and Midrashim) or  medieval texts – philosophy and Kabbalah, in particular allusions to the  works of Moses de Leon who Scholem, for most of his life, regarded as  the author of the Zohar. The notes also contain etymological  considerations and parallel words in other languages, as well as  reference to usage in later Kabbalistic texts and discussion of these  words in works by both early and modern Zohar commentators. </span></div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />To conclude, even though the Scholem  card catalogue cannot be regarded as a fully realized dictionary of the  Zohar, it is still of tremendous value as the only attempt thus far to  prepare a comprehensive dictionary of this kind.&nbsp; Today, the card index  is accessible via the Internet and everyone is free to get a glimpse of  the greatest Kabbalistic scholar at work, and learn much about his  subject as well as his method. </span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="breadCrumbs"><span></span></span></span>            <br /><div class="mainContent" id="mainContent">                    <div class="mainContent">    <div class="rightContent" id="rightContent">       <div class="mainContent_inner">     <div class="mainContent_innerBody" id="mainContent_innerBody">       <div id="mainContent_ForHeight"><div class="menuFrame"><div class="openedMenu"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="mainMenu_item" href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/Pages/default.aspx" title="Scholem Collection"><img src="http://web.nli.org.il/_layouts/NLI_Foundation/Branding/imgs/arrow_white_down.png" />Scholem Collection</a></span><ul><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/Pages/scholem_history.aspx" title="History"><span>History</span><img src="http://web.nli.org.il/_layouts/NLI_Foundation/Branding/imgs/forall_en.png" /></a></span></li><li class="lastLink"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a class="currentLink" href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/scholem-card-catalog/Pages/default.aspx" title="Scholem Card Catalog"><span>Scholem Card Catalog</span><img src="http://web.nli.org.il/_layouts/NLI_Foundation/Branding/imgs/forall_en.png" /></a></span><ul><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/scholem-card-catalog/Pages/search.aspx" title="Catalog Search"><span>Catalog Search</span><img src="http://web.nli.org.il/_layouts/NLI_Foundation/Branding/imgs/forall_en.png" /></a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/scholem-card-catalog/Pages/a-b.aspx" title="Cards Ordered Alphabetically"><span>Cards Ordered Alphabetically</span><img src="http://web.nli.org.il/_layouts/NLI_Foundation/Branding/imgs/forall_en.png" /></a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/scholem-card-catalog/Pages/Search-Guide.aspx" title="Guide to Using the Card Index"><span>Guide to Using the Card Index</span><img src="http://web.nli.org.il/_layouts/NLI_Foundation/Branding/imgs/forall_en.png" /></a></span></li><li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/scholem-card-catalog/Pages/Scholem-Prologue.aspx" title="Scanning of Gershom Scholem's Milon HaZohar Card Index – Yehuda Liebes"><span>Scanning of Gershom Scholem's Milon HaZohar Card Index – Yehuda Liebes</span></a></span></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></blockquote><br />]]></content>
