That seems to have been the first time that  happened in English, although Franz Altheim and Ruth Stiehl had entitled  their study of Sasanian taxation Finanzgeschichte der Spätantike in  1957. However the latter was only about Sasanian Iran and not a general  treatment of finance in Late Antiquity that included the Sasanians.  ...  <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika1-Morony4.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></blockquote></div><blockquote>  <div class="post-1616 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/the-romance-of-artaban-and-artasir-in-agathangelos-history-2/" rel="bookmark" title="The Romance of Artaban and Artašir in Agathangelos’ History">The Romance of Artaban and Artašir in Agathangelos’ History</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Gohar Muradyan, Matenadaran Institute, Yerevan; Aram Topchyan, Matenadaran Institute, Yerevan</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/the-romance-of-artaban-and-artasir-in-agathangelos-history-2/" title="The Romance of Artaban and Artašir in Agathangelos’ History"><img alt="default" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/default.png" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Armenian History by Agathangelos written in the mid‐5th century and nar‐rating about the conversion of Armenia to Christianity in the early fourth century was soon translated into Greek and other languages: Arabic, Old Russian, and Georgian. There also exist shorter re¬cen¬sions (known as The Life of St. Gregory) in Karshuni, Ethio‐pian, Coptic, Greek, Georgian, Latin, and Arabic. The Greek version of the History is extant in nine manuscripts dating from the 8th‐12th cc. Only one of them, kept in the Laurentian library of Florence, Plut. VII, cod. Gr. 25 (12th c.), contains nine initial para‐graphs absent from the Armenian original and from the other recensions.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika2-Muradyan-Aram1.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></div><div class="post-1619 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/sasanian-reflections-in-armenian-sources-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Sasanian Reflections in Armenian Sources">Sasanian Reflections in Armenian Sources</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Tim Greenwood, University of St Andrews</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/sasanian-reflections-in-armenian-sources-2/" title="Sasanian Reflections in Armenian Sources"><img alt="default" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/default.png" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The deep impression of Iran upon all aspects of early mediaeval Armenia has long been recognized. Although linguists may have taken the lead in tracing this influence, scholars in all disciplines, particularly historians and theologians, have unearthed multiple parallels and connections between the two cultures. The penetrating studies by Garsoïan and Russell over the past four decades have proved to be particularly influential, to the extent that no scholar today would seriously contemplate studying early mediaeval Armenia without acknowledging its Iranian heritage.1 Indeed such is the degree of unanimity over the level of Iranian influence upon all aspects of Armenian society and culture that the contention has begun to operate in the opposite direction. Armenian sources have been exploited to shed light upon Iranian, and specifically Sasanian, history.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika3-Greenwood.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></div><div class="post-1621 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/an-exceptional-gold-coin-of-shapur-i-2/" rel="bookmark" title="An Exceptional Gold Coin of Shapur I">An Exceptional Gold Coin of Shapur I</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Armine Zohrabyan, History Museum of Armenia</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/an-exceptional-gold-coin-of-shapur-i-2/" title="An Exceptional Gold Coin of Shapur I"><img alt="ShapurCoin" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/ShapurCoin1-150x150.png" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Recently we have had a chance to see a unique gold coin of Shapur I. Unfortunately the location of this coin today is unknown to us. At first sight, the coin looks like the usual issues of Shapur I (particularly the iconography in obverse), but exploration of some details in reverse give us cause to suppose that it was minted for a certain occasion. Shapur I continued the regional policy of his predecessor, Artashir I, from the beginning of his reign. A series of victories against the Roman Empire opened the way to conquer Armenia, which was the main success of Sasanian Iran in the West. Shapur I represented his glorious victories against Roman Empire in rock sculpture and took a new title, king of kings Iran and non‐Iran, as a result of his successful policy.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika4-Zohrabyan.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></div><div class="post-1625 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/like-father-like-daughter-late-sasanian-imperial-ideology-the-rise-of-boran-to-power-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Like Father, Like Daughter: Late Sasanian Imperial Ideology &amp; the Rise of Bōrān to Power">Like Father, Like Daughter: Late Sasanian Imperial Ideology &amp; the Rise of Bōrān to Power</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Haleh Emrani, University of California, Los Angeles</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/like-father-like-daughter-late-sasanian-imperial-ideology-the-rise-of-boran-to-power-2/" title="Like Father, Like Daughter: Late Sasanian Imperial Ideology &amp; the Rise of Bōrān to Power"><img alt="BoranGoldCoinI-sm" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/BoranGoldCoinI-sm-150x150.jpg" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The  reign of Bōrān and, afterwards that of her sister Āzarmīgduxt, although  short‐lived, were historically significant. No other woman ascended the  Sasanian throne, in her own rights, before or after them. The  significance is even greater in view of the social and cultural  limitations placed on women in Sasanian Iran, as discussed in the  studies presented by scholars such as Jamsheed K. Choksy, Albert De  Jong, and Mansour Shaki. This paper investigates the factors that  legitimized the rise of these women to the throne through the  examination of the ideas of Iranian kingship in general and Sasanian  imperial ideology in particular.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika5-Emrani.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></div><div class="post-1634 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/historical-geography-of-fars-during-the-sasanian-period-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Historical Geography of Fars during the Sasanian Period">Historical Geography of Fars during the Sasanian Period</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Negin Miri, University of Sydney</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/historical-geography-of-fars-during-the-sasanian-period-2/" title="Historical Geography of Fars during the Sasanian Period"><img alt="Miri-map-sm" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/Miri-map-sm1-150x150.jpg" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">There  are few studies in existence which explore the Sasanian historical  geography. The pioneering work of Marquart on the historical geography  of the Sasanian Empire in the book of Ps.- Moses of Chorene is one of  the earliest studies of its kind. Later discoveries of numismatic and  sigillographic finds, as well as publications on and editions of  literary and material evidence, relevant to the historical geography and  administrative organization of the Sasanian Empire did not change  things dramatically, but did help to complete and in some cases correct  early impressions. During the last decades R. Gyselen and Ph. Gignoux  have significantly contributed to the field of Sasanian historical and  administrative geography through their publications and scrutiny of the  sigillographic, numismatic and written sources.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika6-Miri.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></div><div class="post-1632 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/spahbed-bullae-the-barakat-collection-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Spāhbed Bullae: The Barakat Collection">Spāhbed Bullae: The Barakat Collection</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Touraj Daryaee, University of California, Irvine; Keyvan Safdari, University of California, Irvine</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/spahbed-bullae-the-barakat-collection-2/" title="Spāhbed Bullae: The Barakat Collection"><img alt="esasanika-12-fimage" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/esasanika-12-fimage.png" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">This  article brings to light some ten Spāhbed bullae which are housed at the  Barakat Gallery in London.

There is also a bulla from kust ī xwarōfrān  “Southwestern Quarter,” another from the kust ī xwarāsān “Northeastern  Quarter,” and a unique, mostly illegible and unpublished bulla among the  collection as well. Before dealing with the Barakat collection it is  important to provide a historiography of the study of the Spāhbed bullae  and its significance for Sasanian history and civilization.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika7-Safdari-Daryaee.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></div><div class="post-1640 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/the-state-of-research-on-sasanian-painting-2/" rel="bookmark" title="The State of Research on Sasanian Painting">The State of Research on Sasanian Painting</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Matteo Compareti, Venice, Italy</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/the-state-of-research-on-sasanian-painting-2/" title="The State of Research on Sasanian Painting"><img alt="Compareti-sm" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/Compareti-sm3-150x150.jpg" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Despite  very recent discoveries – which are, however mainly fortuitous ones –  the archaeology of pre-Islamic Iran is still badly known. This is  particularly true for the Sasanian period (224-651), a kind of “golden  age” for Persian art and culture that is remembered in later Islamic  sources as the apogee of the Persian Empire. It is a well-known fact  that written sources are practically absent in pre-Islamic Iran if one  excludes official inscriptions in Pahlavi on rock reliefs and the  coinage. For this reason, the archaeological investigation should have  an important role in the reconstruction of the Sasanian past.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika8-Compareti.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></div><h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/sasanian-law-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Sasanian Law">Sasanian Law</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Jany Janos, Pázmány Péter Catholic University, Budapest, Hungary</span></div></div></blockquote><div class="entry-content"><blockquote>   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/sasanian-law-2/" title="Sasanian Law"><img alt="default" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/default.png" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The  proper term for law is the Middle Persian dād although the meaning of  dād is more complex than the Western concept of law. In fact, several  texts attest to the dual meaning of dād as both law and religion,  sometimes understood as a religious law, sometimes as a synonym of  religion, sometimes as a secular law or the king’s command. It is only  the context of the text which is helpful to decide which meaning was  referred to.  In the Pahlawi Riwāyat Accompanying the Dādestān ī Dēnīg dād has the  dual meaning of religion and law: ’when someone goes over from the  (religious) law to which he belongs to another law he is margarzān,  because he is deserting the Good Religion, and he is taking up this bad  law’.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika9-Janos.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span></blockquote><br /><div class="post-1646 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <blockquote class="tr_bq"><h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/the-coins-of-3rd-century-sasanian-iran-and-the-formation-of-historical-criteria-2/" rel="bookmark" title="The Coins of 3rd Century Sasanian Iran and the Formation of Historical Criteria">The Coins of 3rd Century Sasanian Iran and the Formation of Historical Criteria</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Rika Gyselen, C.N.R.S.

We show first how, from a corpus of more or less representative coinage  (A), the numismatic scholar can identify a series of coinage (B). If the  scholar believes that the series has a sufficient number of typological  and stylistic characteristics that distinguish it from general coinage  production, he/she will attribute it to a specific source, that is, to a  specific mint (C1).  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-sasanika10-Gyselen.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></blockquote></div><blockquote>  <div class="post-1650 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/a-strange-date-on-sasanian-drachms-of-kavad-i/" rel="bookmark" title="A Strange Date on Sasanian Drachms of Kavad I">A Strange Date on Sasanian Drachms of Kavad I</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> François Gurnet</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/a-strange-date-on-sasanian-drachms-of-kavad-i/" title="A Strange Date on Sasanian Drachms of Kavad I"><img alt="Gurnet-coin-sm" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/Gurnet-coin-sm-150x150.jpg" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The  reign of Kavad the first is probably the most interesting in Sasanian  history. The chaos caused by Mazdakism during his reign lead to a  restored, strong, monarchy under his son and successor. Kavad I had two  reigns, 488 to 496 and 499 to 531 AD. He succeeded Valkash (484-488) but  was soon deposed by his brother Zamasp (496-499). Three years in exile  Kavad recovered his throne and was eventually succeeded by his son, one  of the most remarkable Sasanian kings, Khusro I (531-579). Kavad had  numerous coin types. The one that interests us here is his first type.  It was used during his first reign, showing no date, and was then used  during the first two years of his second reign, being known for years 11  and 12. A new type was introduced in year 13.  ... <a class="more-link" href="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/e-Sasanika11-Gurnet.pdf" target="_blank">READ MORE</a></span><br />  </div></div><div class="post-1653 esasanika type-esasanika status-publish format-standard hentry entry">     <h2 class="entry-title"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/inscribed-sasanian-bullae-at-the-national-museum-of-iran/" rel="bookmark" title="Inscribed Sasanian Bullae at the National Museum of Iran">Inscribed Sasanian Bullae at the National Museum of Iran</a></span></h2><div class="author_name tax"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Author: </span></span><div class="authors"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Daryoush Akbarzadeh, National Museum of Iran; Touraj Daryaee, University of California, Irvine</span></div></div><div class="entry-content">   <span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.sasanika.org/esasanika/inscribed-sasanian-bullae-at-the-national-museum-of-iran/" title="Inscribed Sasanian Bullae at the National Museum of Iran"><img alt="Akbarzadeh-bulla-sm" class="alignleft post-image" height="150" src="http://www.sasanika.org/wp-content/uploads/Akbarzadeh-bulla-sm-150x150.jpg" width="150" /></a></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sasanian  bullae are important objects in understanding the economic and  administrative history Ērānšahr.

The  collection under study here provide further evidence to different  localities, some known and others of unknown provenance. However, these  collections provide a microcosm of economic history of several provinces  of the Iranian Plateau.
